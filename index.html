                <h3>Hi, I’m John McPhedran from New Zealand.</h3>

                <p>I built my first WordPress site in 2010 and quickly became fascinated by the world of online marketing and the technology behind it. Since then, I’ve continued to grow my skills through self-study and a range of courses in web development, digital marketing, and e-commerce.</p>

                <p>I’ve been working professionally in marketing technology since 2013, but over time, I’ve found the programming and development side of my work to be the most interesting. That’s led me to actively pursue more opportunities in web development.</p>
